<h1>About Encryption</h1>

<p>Google Browser Sync will use your PIN to encrypt your saved
passwords and persistent cookies. Your PIN is only stored locally on
the computers where you install Google Browser Sync so other computers
will not be able to decrypt your data unless they can guess your
PIN.  For added security, use a longer PIN that includes both numbers
and letters. You can choose which browser settings you'd like to
encrypt but passwords and cookies must be encrypted if you choose to
synchronize them.</p>
