#summary How to set up a develop environment for BrowserSync

Setting up BrowserSync for development is pretty easy.

=Check out the code=

To check out the code, you'll need an SVN client. Download one here: http://subversion.tigris.org/.

Once you have one, go to the [http://code.google.com/p/browsersync/source/checkout source tab] to see the commands to issue to check out.

=Set up a development profile=

It will make this easier if you set up a special Firefox profile for development.

*Mac/Linux*:
{{{
mkdir -p p1/extensions
echo "path/to/browsersync/client/" > "p1/extensions/browserstate@google.com"
}}}

*Windows*:
{{{
mkdir p1
mkdir p1\extensions
echo "c:\path\to\browsersync\client\" > "p1\extensions\browserstate@google.com"
}}}

Next, create a file called `user.js` in the profile folder, and copy the following lines into it:

{{{
user_pref("nglayout.debug.disable_xul_cache",true);
user_pref("browser.dom.window.dump.enabled",true);
user_pref("javascript.options.showInConsole",true);
user_pref("extensions.logging.enabled",true);
}}}

=Development Extensions (Optional)=

There are some extensions that are useful for extension developers:

  * [http://ted.mielczarek.org/code/mozilla/extensiondev/ Extension Developer's Extension]
  * [http://www.getfirebug.com/releases/ ChromeBug]

=Running it=

To run Firefox with your development Clobber, start Firefox like this from the command line:

*Windows*
{{{
c:\program files\mozilla firefox\firefox.exe -profile p1 -no-remote -console
}}}

*Mac/Linux*
{{{
/path/to/firefox -profile p1 -no-remote -console
}}}

Firefox will load the extension directly from your extension directory. This means that there is no build phase to hacking on Gears. Just make your changes and restart the browser.
